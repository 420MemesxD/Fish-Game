# Fish-Game

This game is a game made in Unity version 2021.3.20f1. The goal of this game is to catch the fish to increase your score while also dodging bombs to avoid losing the game. Scince this game was made in Unity all the scripts are coded in c#. I have added a main menu for when the game first opens here the player can choose to start playing or exit the game. once the game is started fish will start raining down from the sky and the player can use the arrowkeys to move the "player". The player is just a net that is used to catch the items. If the player catches a fish their score will increase and bombs will end the game. Once the game is ended it will stop spawning fish and bombs, tell the player that they lost and after four seconds bring the player back to the start menu. The game is very simple in concept but can be fun!
